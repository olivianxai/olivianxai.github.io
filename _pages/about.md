Hello, welcome to my home page. My name is Peiyu, or in Chinese characters, 珮毓, but I usually go by Olivia. I am currently a second-year PhD student at University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervison of Dr. Leilani Gilpin. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Human-centered Explainable AI, Neuro-symbolic AI, and the interdisciplinary study of law and AI.
I received by Master's from the George Washington University, and my Bachelor's from the University of Delaware. Before UCSC, I was a Software Engineer at VMware. When I am not doing research, I am usually food photographying, or animal whispering.
There is a Chinese phrase that I really like, as it summarizes my research - 无规矩，不成方圆
